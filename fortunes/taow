    It (the art of war) is a matter of life and death, a road either

    The art of war, then, is governed by five constant
    factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations.
    These are:  (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth;
    (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

    The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete

    regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.

    By method and discipline are to be understood
    the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions,
    the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance
    of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the
    control of military expenditure.

    These five heads should be familiar to every general:

    not will fail.

    Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking
    to determine the military conditions, let them be made
    the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--
    (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued
        with the Moral law?
    (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?
    (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven
        and Earth?
    (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
    (5) Which army is stronger?
    (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
    (7) In which army is there the greater constancy
        both in reward and punishment?
    By means of these seven considerations I can
    forecast victory or defeat.

    The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts

    Now the general who wins a battle makes many
    calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. 
    The general who loses a battle makes but few
    calculations beforehand.  Thus do many calculations
    lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: 
    how much more no calculation at all!  It is by attention
    to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

    Sun Tzu said:  In the operations of war,
    where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots,
    as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand
    mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them
    a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front,
    including entertainment of guests, small items such as
    glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor,
    will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. 
    Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.

    When you engage in actual fighting, if victory
    is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and

    On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes

    Sun Tzu said:  In the practical art of war, the best
    thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact;
    to shatter and destroy it is not so good.  So, too, it is

    Thus the highest form of generalship is to
    balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent
    the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in
    order is to attack the enemy's army in the field;
    and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.

    The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it

    against the walls will take three months more.

    The general, unable to control his irritation,

    effects of a siege.

    There are three ways in which a ruler can bring
    misfortune upon his army:--
    (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat,
    being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. 
    This is called hobbling the army.
    (2) By attempting to govern an army in the
    same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant
    of the conditions which obtain in an army.  This causes
    restlessness in the soldier's minds.
    (3) By employing the officers of his army
    without discrimination, through ignorance of the
    military principle of adaptation to circumstances. 
    This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    But when the army is restless and distrustful,

        and inferior forces.
    (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same
        spirit throughout all its ranks.
    (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take

    baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;
    the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.

    In order to carry out an attack, we must have
    means available.  The material for raising fire should
    always be kept in readiness.

    There is a proper season for making attacks with fire,
    and special days for starting a conflagration.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XII: The Attack by Fire
%
    The proper season is when the weather is very dry;
    the special days are those when the moon is in the
    constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing
    or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.

    In attacking with fire, one should be prepared
    to meet five possible developments:
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XII: The Attack by Fire
%
    (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp,
    respond at once with an attack from without.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XII: The Attack by Fire
%
    (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's
    soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XII: The Attack by Fire
%
    (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height,
    follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable;
    if not, stay where you are.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XII: The Attack by Fire
%
    (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire
    from without, do not wait for it to break out within,
    but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XII: The Attack by Fire
%
    (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. 
    Do not attack from the leeward.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long,
    but a night breeze soon falls.

    In every army, the five developments connected with
    fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated,
    and a watch kept for the proper days.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;
    those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted,
    but not robbed of all his belongings.

    Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his
    battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating
    the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time
    and general stagnation.

    Move not unless you see an advantage; use not
    your troops unless there is something to be gained;
    fight not unless the position is critical.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    No ruler should put troops into the field merely
    to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight
    a battle simply out of pique.

    If it is to your advantage, make a forward move;
    if not, stay where you are.

    Sun Tzu said:  Raising a host of a hundred thousand
    men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss
    on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. 
    The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces
    of silver.  There will be commotion at home and abroad,
    and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. 
    As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded
    in their labor.

    Hostile armies may face each other for years,
    striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. 
    This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's
    condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred
    ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height
    of inhumanity.

    One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present

    Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good
    general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond
    the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits;
    it cannot be obtained inductively from experience,
    nor by any deductive calculation.

    Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only

    Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: 
    (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies;
    (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.

    When these five kinds of spy are all at work,
    none can discover the secret system.  This is called "divine
    manipulation of the threads."  It is the sovereign's
    most precious faculty.

    Having local spies means employing the services
    of the inhabitants of a district.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XIII: The Use of Spies
%
    Having inward spies, making use of officials
    of the enemy.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XIII: The Use of Spies
%
    Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's
    spies and using them for our own purposes.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XIII: The Use of Spies
%
    Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly
    for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know
    of them and report them to the enemy.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XIII: The Use of Spies
%
    Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring
    back news from the enemy's camp.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

%
    Hence it is that which none in the whole army are
    more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. 
    None should be more liberally rewarded.  In no other
    business should greater secrecy be preserved.

    Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain
    intuitive sagacity.

    If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy

    Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm
    a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always
    necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants,
    the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general
    in command.  Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XIII: The Use of Spies
%
    The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us
    must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and
    comfortably housed.  Thus they will become converted
    spies and available for our service.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu
				  Chapter XIII: The Use of Spies
%
    It is through the information brought by the
    converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ
    local and inward spies.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    It is owing to his information, again, that we can
    cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.

    Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving
    spy can be used on appointed occasions.
				--The Art of War by Sun Tzu

    The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties
    is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only
    be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. 
    Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated
    with the utmost liberality.

    Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I

    Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the
    wise general who will use the highest intelligence of
    the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve
    great results.  Spies are a most important element in water,
    because on them depends an army's ability to move.
